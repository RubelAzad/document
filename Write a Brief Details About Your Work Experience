I currently serve as a Senior Software Engineer at API Solutions LTD, where I play a dual role in two prominent projects. Firstly, I lead a dynamic team in developing the HAEFA Electronic Medical Record System, overseeing its progress and ensuring its seamless functionality. Additionally, I contribute my expertise as a Backend Engineer to the IFAD e-commerce project, bolstering its backend infrastructure.

My journey in the tech industry has been diverse, having previously held positions in various companies. At Nec Money Transfer LTD, I engaged in multiple projects, including the development of NEC Cargo, Nec Currency Converter, and NEC Online Quiz Platform. Additionally, my role extended to contributing to an ERP system, enriching my skill set and broadening my experience.

Throughout my career, I have not only honed my technical skills but also embraced opportunities to share knowledge and expertise as a trainer. This multifaceted experience has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of software development across different domains, enabling me to thrive in complex projects and dynamic team environments.
