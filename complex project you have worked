In my role at HAEFA, I actively contributed to the development of the Nirog Plus app using PHP and the Laravel 8 framework. As the lead developer, I played a crucial role in designing and building the application, following the HMVC pattern to create a modular and scalable architecture for the CMS. To ensure code quality and performance, I implemented rigorous testing procedures for individual modules, optimizing database queries and addressing any potential N+1 query issues. I focused on writing clear and concise comments and documentation for better code understanding and maintainability. Additionally, I optimized Eloquent models and implemented reusable functions, contributing to a more efficient and maintainable codebase. Through these efforts, I successfully delivered a high-quality, performant application for Nirog Plus.
