Driven by a passion for leadership, I currently serve as a team leader in my current position, and I am committed to further enhancing my leadership capabilities. My objective is to transition into a role as a project manager, leveraging my technical expertise and team leadership skills to deliver successful projects. With a keen eye for emerging technologies and a dedication to continuous learning, I am poised to contribute significantly to both backend development and project management realms. My goal is to be at the forefront of innovation, leading teams to excellence and delivering impactful solutions in the dynamic field of software engineering.
